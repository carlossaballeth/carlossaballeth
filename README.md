### Hi! Nice to see you! 🧑🏽‍💻😎⚡

I'm passionate about software development and I work as a <b>Full Stack Web Developer</b>, originally an Electronic Engineer, with foundation in both hardware and software. 
My early career involved developing firmware for microcontrollers like PIC and Arduino, which provided me with an understanding of low-level programming and hardware interfacing.

Currently, I am dedicated to <b>Web Development</b>, where I have honed my skills in <b>front-end</b> and <b>back-end technologies</b>.
I prioritize writing clean, maintainable code and follow best practices in software development.

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions.
I'm from Colombia 🇨🇴, willing to work remotely anywhere in the world.
